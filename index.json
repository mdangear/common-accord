In connection with Section 1.2.1, the Purchase Amount will be due and payable by the Company to the Investor immediately prior to, or concurrent with, the consummation of the {{def.Liquidity_Event}}. If there are not enough funds to pay the Investor and holders of other Safes (collectively, the \"Cash-Out Investors\") in full, then all of the Company's available funds will be distributed with equal priority and pro rata among the Cash-Out Investors in proportion to their Purchase Amounts, and the Cash-Out Investors will automatically receive the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the remaining unpaid Purchase Amount divided by the Liquidity Price. In connection with a Change of Control intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization, the Company may reduce, pro rata, the Purchase Amounts payable to the Cash-Out Investors by the amount determined by its board of directors in good faith to be advisable for such Change of Control to qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and in such case, the Cash-Out Investors will automatically receive the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the remaining unpaid Purchase Amount divided by the Liquidity Price."
